## Code Style

El7a2ny Virtual Clinic and Pharmacy follows a clear and organized coding structure based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and scalability by isolating the application logic, user interface, and data.

### MVC Architecture

- **Model:** Manages data and business logic. This layer is responsible for interacting with the database and processing data.

- **View:** Presents information to the user and handles user interface components. This layer ensures a clean separation between the application's logic and its presentation.

- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, processing user input and updating the Model and View accordingly. This layer helps in maintaining the flow of data between the Model and View.

### Routes for Code Organization

To enhance code readability and maintainability, we leverage routing mechanisms. Routes in our application serve as a roadmap, making it easier to understand the flow of data and actions within the codebase. This approach results in cleaner and more organized code.
